# Basic-Hotel-Management-System


In this hotel management system, the user can perform basic operations such as booking a room, cancelling a booking, and displaying available/occupied rooms. 
The program uses two classes: `Room` to represent individual rooms in the hotel, and `Hotel` to manage a collection of `Room` objects.

The `Room` class stores information such as the room number, capacity, and whether the room is currently occupied or not. The `Hotel` class contains a vector of `Room` 
objects and provides methods to book/cancel bookings and display available/occupied rooms.

The main function of the program displays a menu of options to the user and allows them to choose an operation to perform. The program uses a switch 
statement to execute the appropriate method of the `Hotel` class based on the user's choice.
